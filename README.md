# TS2Extender
 
An early mod that aims to extend TS2 by implementing tweaks, fixes and additions.

Currently offers borderless and windowed toggles, plus fixes the game's Random Number Generator, solving problems like Firstborn Syndrome.

Tested with The Sims 2 Legacy.

# Installation

Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/TS2-Extender/releases/latest) tab and extract the files into your TSBin folder where your game executable is located.
