# TS2 Extender
 
An early work in progress mod that aims to extend TS2 by implementing tweaks, fixes and additions.

Only tested to work with The Sims 2 Legacy for Steam. EA App version might not work.

## Current Features

* Borderless fullscreen mode*
* Skip intro videos.
* Fixes the game's random number generator, solving Firstborn Syndrome and other random number quirks.
* Restores removed Lua functionality for modders.

A "Sims2.ini" file is provided that should be placed in TSBin in order for borderless to work. This file should be removed if you wish to play normal fullscreen, as it's there to make the game launch windowed.

## Installation

Download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/TS2-Extender/releases/latest) tab and extract the files into your TSBin folder where your game executable is located, should be in the "EP9" folder in your game's installation directory.

The mod can be configured via the .ini file.
