# TS2 Extender
 
An early work in progress mod that aims to extend TS2 Legacy by implementing tweaks, fixes and additions.

Tested to work with The Sims 2 Legacy for Steam.

## Features

* Skip intro videos.
* Adds completely new Lua functionality for modders, plus a Lua script loader.

## Fixes

* Fixes the game's random number generator, solving Firstborn Syndrome and other random number quirks.
* Fixes Open For Business uniforms messing up employee's faces.
* Fixes broken date stood up timer.
* Fixes aging and other timed events randomly breaking permanently in saves.
* Fixes broken wall cutaway textures.

## Installation

* Firstly, download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/LazyDuchess/TS2-Extender/releases/latest) tab.
* Extract the zip. Inside you will find a "TSBin", a "Downloads" and a "TSData" folder.
* The "TSBin" and "TSData" folders go into your game's installation directory -> EP9, overriding the folders that are already there. Example: "E:\Steam\steamapps\common\The Sims 2 Legacy Collection\EP9"
* The "Downloads" folder goes into your "Documents/EA Games/The Sims 2 Legacy" folder. Make sure custom content is enabled in your in-game settings.
* If everything went well, you should have the new features in your game, and you will also have a new cheat command: "ts2extender", which will tell you the current TS2 Extender version (Cheat console can be opened with Shift+Control+C) :
